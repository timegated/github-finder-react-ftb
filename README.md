# UI that uses github's api to search and retrieve users and repositories

## Checklist
* [X] Created a UI with class and functional components
* [X] All state managed in one top level component - App.js
* [X] Actions are passed up from components to top level where methods are called


## Refactoring to Hooks + Context
* [] Remove all class components and implement hooks for managing state and lifecycle methods
* [] Use Context API to "pass" state around to components that need it
